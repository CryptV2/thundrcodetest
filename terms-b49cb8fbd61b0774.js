Offline Interactions\n\n    The Company is not liable for the actions or conduct of any user, whether online or offline. Users are solely responsible for their interactions and must exercise appropriate caution when communicating with new people, especially if offline. We do not encourage offline communications or meeting in real life. If you must insist on engaging offline, we strongly recommend that users take all necessary precautions to ensure their safety in any offline interactions, including but not limited to meeting in public places, informing friends or family of their whereabouts, and conducting their own research into the background of other users. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY HARM, LOSS, OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM OFFLINE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN USERS.\n\n    4. MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT OF USER INTERACTIONS\n    A. 	Monitoring\n    We reserve the right to monitor User Interactions in our sole discretion and take any action with respect thereto that we deem necessary or appropriate, including if we believe that any User Interaction violates these Terms, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Service or the public, or could create liability for the Company, as determined in our sole discretion.

We do not endorse any user and you are solely responsible for determining the suitability of any user you interact with.\n    B. 	AI Moderation\n    Our Service employs real-time AI moderation to help enforce our rules and policies. While we strive for accuracy, AI moderation is not infallible.

Enforcement\n    We may disclose any information monitored by us, including without limitation, any referral to law enforcement for any illegal activities conducted through the Service.  We do not endorse any illegal activities conducted through the Service and reserve the right to fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court orders directing us to disclose any information obtained through the Service. YOU WAIVE AND HOLD THE COMPANY HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES DURING, OR TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF, INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER SUCH PARTIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.\n    D. 	Reporting Misconduct\n    We strive to ensure User Interactions comply with these Terms, but acknowledge that our capabilities have limitations. Users are encouraged to report any inappropriate behavior, harassment, abuse, or violations of these Terms by reaching out to our support team at [EMAIL].\n    5. IN SERVICE PURCHASES\n\n    From time to time, you may make a purchase of a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use or access special limited-use features including but not limited to credits redeemable on virtual items, such as our “Boost” functionality (“Enhancements”). Purchases are made using the Payment Method you provide through the Service.\xa0Enhancements represent a limited license right governed by these Terms, and, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, no title or ownership in or to Enhancements is being transferred or assigned to you. This Section should not be construed as a sale of any rights in Enhancements. Any Enhancement balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license. Enhancements do not incur fees for non-use; however, the license granted to you will terminate in accordance with the terms of these Terms, on the earlier of when we cease providing our Service.\n\n    If you make a purchase, you agree to pay the prices displayed to you for the Services you’ve selected as well as any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your payments (and as may change from time to time), and you authorize the Company, using its third party payment processors, to charge the payment method you provide (your “Payment Method”). We may correct any billing errors or mistakes even if we have already requested or received payment. If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, you will remain responsible for the payment amounts.\n\n    ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF ENHANCEMENTS MADE THROUGH OUR SERVICES ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.

You agree to cooperate with the Company’s defense of these claims. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of Company. This indemnification obligation will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms and your use of the Service.\n\n    8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES\n    You understand that we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that the Service will be free of viruses, bugs or other destructive code. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your specific requirements for anti-virus protection and accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a means external to our Service for any reconstruction of any lost data.

RELIANCE ON INFORMATION\n    Any third-party information and User Interactions on the Service are provided solely by between users or received from other third parties, and the Company does not provide any independent information and only facilitates the exchange of such information between the users. We rely on third-party data, which may be inaccurate, outdated, or flawed. The information presented on or through the Service is made available solely for general information purposes. WE DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF THIS INFORMATION. ANY RELIANCE YOU PLACE ON SUCH INFORMATION IS STRICTLY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Arbitration Agreement\n    To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, you and the Company each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Service (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by final and binding, individual arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association applying Arizona law located in Phoenix, AZ. Notwithstanding the forgoing, (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.\n    The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the “Class Action Waiver” section above.

Jury Trial Waiver\n    IN THE EVENT THAT ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, BOTH PARTIES KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM.

Waiver and Severability\n\n    No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set out in these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
